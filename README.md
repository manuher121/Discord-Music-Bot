# Discord-Music-Bot
Python Music Bot using Youtube
Description
This is a python bot from discord. Its a code is inspired by two other repositories (Rapptz/Discord.py and Kakarot-2000/Wall-e). It was built for me and my friends to use after the ban of the bot Rythm.  As far as i know you cannot launch the bot on Heroku(i tried to keep it runnig even when i am not home but i could not find any other options). The program is for personal use since its illegal for any other purpose.
