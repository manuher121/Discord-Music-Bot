# Discord-Music-Bot
Python Music Bot using Youtube
Description
This is a python bot from discord. Its a code is inspired by two other repositories (Rapptz/Discord.py and Kakarot-2000/Wall-e). It was built for me and my friends to use after the ban of the bot Rythm.  As far as i know you cannot launch the bot on Heroku(i tried to keep it runnig even when i am not home but i could not find any other options). The program is for personal use since its illegal for any other purpose.
After running the file discord_bot.py it should open a terminal and say that it was correctly logged in.
The most used commands are '!play myfavoritesongfromyoutube' to play a song(you can also use a link) and '!stop' to stop playing music.
